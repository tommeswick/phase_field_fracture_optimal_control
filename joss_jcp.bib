abstract = "deal.II is a state-of-the-art finite element library focused on generality, dimension-independent programming, parallelism, and extensibility. Herein, we outline its primary design considerations and its sophisticated features such as distributed meshes, hp-adaptivity, support for complex geometries, and matrix-free algorithms. But deal.II is more than just a software library: It is also a diverse and worldwide community of developers and users, as well as an educational platform. We therefore also discuss some of the technical and social challenges and lessons learned in running a large community software project over the course of two decades."

        abstract = {The purpose of this work is the development of space-time discretization schemes for phase-field optimal control problems. Specifically in the optimal control minimization problem, a tracking-type cost functional is minimized to steer the crack via the phase-field variable into a desired pattern. To achieve such optimal solutions, Neumann type boundary conditions need to be determined. First, a time discretization of the forward problem is derived using a discontinuous Galerkin formulation. Here, a challenge is to include regularization terms and the crack irreversibility constraint. The optimal control setting is formulated by means of the Lagrangian approach from which the primal part, adjoint, tangent and adjoint Hessian are derived. Herein the overall Newton algorithm is based on a reduced approach by eliminating the state constraint, namely the displacement and phase-field unknowns, but keeping the control variable as the only unknown. From the low-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization, adjoint time-stepping schemes are finally obtained. Both our formulation and algorithmic developments are substantiated and illustrated with six numerical experiments.}
